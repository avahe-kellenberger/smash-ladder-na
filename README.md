# Smash Ladder NA

**Live at [smash-ladder-na.vercel.app](https://smash-ladder-na.vercel.app/) · Community: [Discord](https://discord.gg/zE8B44vQxf)**

A ranked ladder site for the NA *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* community. Players sign in with
Discord, get matched 1v1 through a lobby queue, self-report best-of-3 results, and climb a
seasonal rating. The site also supports casual free-battle matchmaking, community tournaments
(bracket hosted on [start.gg](https://www.start.gg), with live entrant/standing data pulled
in automatically), character leaderboards, and moderation tooling for disputes and conduct
reports.

Independent from — and not affiliated with — Japan's Smashmate or other existing Smash
matchmaking platforms; this is an unrelated, separately-run project built for the NA scene.

## Why this exists

There are existing closed-source matchmaking platforms for Smash in NA. This project's angle is
being open-source: the community can inspect, contribute to, and shape the platform directly,
and the moderation policies that govern ranked play are transparent rather than a black box.

## Features

- **Ranked ladder** — lobby-based matchmaking, best-of-3 stage striking, self-reported results
  with a dispute flow when reports disagree, and Elo-style rating per season.
- **Free battle** — casual matchmaking outside the ranked ladder.
- **Tournaments** — community-hosted brackets linked to start.gg; entrant count and final
  standings are fetched live from the start.gg API once configured.
- **Character leaderboards** — full *Ultimate* roster (including all DLC).
- **Discord integration** — sign-in via Discord OAuth, plus optional DM notifications through a
  Discord bot.
- **Moderation** — conduct reports with threshold-based suspend/ban actions, and a disputed-game
  resolution queue for admins/mods.
- **Region-aware matchmaking**, with an optional launch-region lock for a staged rollout.

## Tech stack

Next.js (App Router) · React · TypeScript · Prisma + PostgreSQL · Auth.js (NextAuth) with
Discord OAuth · Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui · Sentry.

## Getting started

No external accounts needed — Docker handles the database and a built-in dev login replaces
Discord OAuth.

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start a local Postgres database:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. Generate backend:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — click "Sign in" and enter any username.

### Switch API development

The initial REST surface is available under `/api/v1` and every request
requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Local development uses the dummy
token `smash-ladder-local-development-token` from `.env.development`:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer smash-ladder-local-development-token' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer smash-ladder-local-development-token' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/config
```

Production does not fall back to the dummy token. Set
`SMASH_LADDER_API_TOKEN` explicitly until per-user API tokens replace this
temporary shared-token guard.

The checked-in `.env.development` file has everything pre-configured for this local setup. If
you want to use a remote database or real Discord OAuth instead, copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill in the values.

### Working with realistic data locally

A fresh local DB only has a handful of seeded test accounts — not enough to build or sanity-check
something like a stats page against. If you were handed an anonymized snapshot file (production
match/rating/season history with all emails, IPs, and Discord/Twitch/start.gg identities stripped
or never included), import it with:

```bash
psql "$(grep DATABASE_URL .env.development | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"')" < snapshot.sql
```

This replaces your local dev DB's data entirely. Only the project owner can generate a new
snapshot (needs production DB access) via `scripts/snapshot-prod-anonymized.sh` — ask in the mod
channel if you need one regenerated.

## Testing

Run the unit tests (pure functions — rank tiers, Elo math, regions, etc., no database) with:

```bash
npm test
```

Use `npm run test:watch` for watch mode during development. Tests live alongside the source
files they cover (`src/lib/*.test.ts`) and run in CI on every push and pull request.

Core flows that touch the database — lobby pairing, Elo confirmation, match finalization, and
dispute resolution — have integration tests (`src/lib/*.integration.test.ts`) that run against a
real Postgres database instead of mocking it. Locally, point them at a separate database (so
they can truncate freely without touching your dev data):

```bash
createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres smashladder_test
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/smashladder_test" \
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/smashladder_test" \
  npx prisma migrate deploy

npm run test:integration
```

CI runs these against a disposable Postgres service container — no local setup needed there.
